# Environment-aware Components

An exploration into loading and rendering the most suitable version of a component based on signals exposed to the web (network, CPU, memory etc).

## Deployment
```
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

## Demos

### Simpler
* [Network-aware loading](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/network-aware-components/tree/master/cra-network-aware-component) with create-react-app ([demo](https://us-central1-adaptive-loading.cloudfunctions.net/app/cra-network-aware-component/))
* [Network-aware code-splitting](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/network-aware-components/tree/master/cra-network-aware-code-splitting) with create-react-app ([demo](https://us-central1-adaptive-loading.cloudfunctions.net/app/cra-network-aware-code-splitting/))
* [Network-aware data-fetching](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/environment-aware-components/tree/master/cra-network-aware-data-fetching) with create-react-app ([demo](https://us-central1-adaptive-loading.cloudfunctions.net/app/cra-network-aware-data-fetching/))
* [Battery considerate loading](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/environment-aware-components/tree/master/cra-battery-considerate-loading) with create-react-app ([demo](https://us-central1-adaptive-loading.cloudfunctions.net/app/cra-battery-considerate-loading/))
* [Memory considerate loading](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/environment-aware-components/tree/master/cra-memory-considerate-loading) with create-react-app ([demo](https://us-central1-adaptive-loading.cloudfunctions.net/app/cra-memory-considerate-loading/))
* [Memory considerate loading (SketchFab version)](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/environment-aware-components/tree/master/cra-memory-considerate-loading-sketchfab) with create-react-app ([demo](https://us-central1-adaptive-loading.cloudfunctions.net/app/cra-memory-considerate-loading-sketchfab/))
* [Device-class aware loading](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/environment-aware-components/tree/master/cra-device-class-aware-loading) ([demo](https://us-central1-adaptive-loading.cloudfunctions.net/app/cra-device-class-aware-loading/))
