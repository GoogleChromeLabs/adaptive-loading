# Adaptive Loading

An exploration into loading and rendering the most suitable version of a component based on signals exposed to the web (network, CPU, memory etc).

## Source & Components

This repo contains several different pieces for the Adaptive Loading project: React Hooks, patterns for adaptive loading with different Web Platform signals and full applications.

## Deployment

Create Firebase Project by logging in to [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com) and replace the default value in `/.firebaserc` and `/functions/.firebaserc` with the created Project ID.
Or simply copy the default value from `/.firebaserc` or `/functions/.firebaserc` and paste as the Project ID when creating the Firebase Project.

### Function deployment
```
firebase init functions
```
Skip `Overwrite` options by entering `No`
```
firebase deploy
```

### Host deployment
```
npm run build
npm run deploy
```
