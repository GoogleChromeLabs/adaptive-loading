# Demo: React-twitter save-data resource loading in React

[Live Demo](https://adaptive-loading.web.app/react-twitter-save-data-loading)

This is a demo of the Twitter timeline implemented using React and the Save-Data Client Hint. It determines whether to load low-fidelity or high-fidelity images based on the user's Data Saver (Lite Mode) preferences on Chrome for Android.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and Node.js/Express.js for server side.

## Installation

git clone https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/adaptive-loading
