# Demo: React-movie network-aware resource loading in React

[React Movie](https://github.com/oliver-gomes/react-movie) is an application for browsing the latest movies, viewing summaries of them and seeing a cast list.

This version of React movie uses network-aware loading to determine whether to load low-fidelity or high-fidelity movie posters based on the user's effective connection type (e.g 2G -> lo-fi, 4G -> hi-fi).

[Live Demo](https://adaptive-loading.web.app/react-movie-network-aware-loading)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/adaptive-loading

```
