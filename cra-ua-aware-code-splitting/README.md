# Demo: UA-aware code-splitting with React

[Live Demo](https://adaptive-loading.web.app/cra-ua-aware-code-splitting)

A demo showing how to use UA-aware code-splitting with React. Utilities for UA parsing provided by [ua-parser-js](https://github.com/faisalman/ua-parser-js).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Note: Device classification in this example is extremely basic. See [device-year-class](https://github.com/facebook/device-year-class) or explore custom device -> CPU mapping using a data-source like Geekbench for a production solution.

## Installation
